# This file should contain env vars that normally need to be present, but whose values themselves shouldn't matter
# when running the tests. For example, URL to a service which is mocked when running the tests.
# The point is to let us use .fetch() in settings.yml.deploy but to not have that blow up in CI due to missing env vars.
# Values in here will overwrite your current env vars anytime Rails.env is 'test' - see EnvVarBootstrap.
